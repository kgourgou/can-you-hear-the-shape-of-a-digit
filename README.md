# Can you hear the shape of a digit?

The data comes from the digit-recognizer competition on kaggle (not uploaded here, but easy to find).

A reference for this work (discovered after the initial idea came to me) is "Shape recognition using eigenvalues of the Dirichlet Laplacian" by Khabou, Hermi and Rhouma, 2007.
